The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
##Summary

General

Refactoring lowers the amount of code fabrication needed, as an existing body of work can be modified. Also, it implicity forces you to think about how you plan to build the code and whether any previous projects are similar enough to be refactored. However, it can be frustrating or even a detriment of time/effort to refactor code if you aren't open to other ideas that could ha ve a better runtime/performance, hwich is why you need to think about process and your experiences while being agnostic to any direct route at the beginning.
